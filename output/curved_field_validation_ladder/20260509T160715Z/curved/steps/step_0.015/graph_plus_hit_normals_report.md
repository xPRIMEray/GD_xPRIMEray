# Graph Plus Hit Normals Report

Post-process diagnostic report only. This does not modify renderer behavior and does not claim physical truth.

## Outputs

## Normal Coherence Inside Ownership Nodes

| node | hit samples | mean angle | max angle | label |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | 8 | 0.0 | 0.0 | coherent |
| 1 | 8 | 0.0 | 0.0 | coherent |

## Seam Alignment

- Edge count: 1
- Edges with normal deltas: 1
- Max normal-angle delta: 0.0
- Assessment: No strong seam/normal-discontinuity alignment was measured.

## Unresolved Islands

- Unstable rows: 0
- Assessment: No unstable subgraph rows were present; no abnormal island normal behavior can be assessed.

## Merge/Split Regions

- Merge/split rows: 0
- Assessment: No merge/split rows were present in this graph packet.
